    "question":"<b>My Father’s Office</b> <br>I went to my father’s office yesterday. He works for a bank. The bank building has a big hall. The hall has many desks. Each desk is the seat of one employee. This person – the employee - sits on a chair behind the desk. Two more chairs are there in front of the employee’s desk. Visitors can use those chairs. <br>Each employee has his own set of stationery items. Like others, my father’s desk has files, pens, and wads of paper, letter tray, marker, notebook, pad, punch, stapler, paper clips and ball pens. It also has a computer workstation. A wastepaper basket is kept under the desk. A file cabinet stands at the side of his desk. Father puts his files in it at the end of the day. Finished files are kept in a big cupboard across the hall. Confidential documents are kept in a safe. The keys of the safe remain with father’s boss, the Bank Manager. I found many documents on father’s desk. Each desk had a fan on top of it. They are going to fix air conditioning machines in the office. Then the fans will not be needed. <br>A conference room is located at the corner of the hall. Meetings happen here. The door of the room closes automatically. It is well decorated. It has a bookshelf, a cupboard, a big round table and many chairs. It also has a screen with a projector. The floor of conference rooms is covered with a carpet. There are curtains on windows of this room. <br>There is a small canteen on one side of the office. It has a tea-coffee machine. People can fill their cups with tea or coffee from the machine. I was thirsty. I took a glass and drank water from the drinking water dispenser. Sometimes my father goes outside office and takes fruit juice from a shop. <br>The office hours ended at 5pm. Father put the stationery inside his desk and locked it. He put the phone directory in his briefcase. He took the last few papers from the desk and went to a small machine near the exit door. It is called the “paper shredder”. It cuts paper into numerous small pieces. He used the shredder to destroy some old papers. <br> <br>Uses to be noted: <br># Work for, at the end of the day, across the hall, remain with <br># Note passive voice in ‘wastepaper basket is kept’, ‘will not be needed’, ‘conference room is located’, ‘The floor of conference rooms is covered with a carpet’. <br># Seat (noun) vs. sit (verb) <br># Note the use of the verbs ‘put’ and ‘use’ carefully. <br># The word ‘Stationery’ is used both as singular and plural. <br> <br>Questions: <br>1. Translate the above into Bengali. <br>2. Have you ever visited any government office with somebody ? If yes, can you tell us in brief how that setting is different from the above setting ? <br>3. If you are asked to put things of your choice into an office, what would you put there ?",
